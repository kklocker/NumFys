\section{Introduction}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:SE}
i\hbar\pdv{\psi}{t} = H\psi
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} 
\label{eq:TISE}
H\psi_n = E_n\psi_n 
\end{equation}

Throughout the report, quantities with a bar ($\bar A$) that may have an analytic counterpart ($A$),  will represent quantities which are (to be) computed.
